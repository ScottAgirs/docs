You can simulate your machine as if it were live in Simulate Mode. Your machine will start in the initial state, and any possible events that can be triggered are highlighted in blue. Press any available event to walkthrough your machine.

Eventless (always) events will be triggered instantly upon entering their source state, unless they’re guarded with a condition. Delayed (after) events will be taken automatically after the timer has completed.
